USAGE:
$("#foo").autodate();

EXAMPLES:
01 - expands to: {current year}-{current month}-01
0102 - expands to: {current year}-02-01
010212 - expands to: 2012-02-01
010251 - expands to: 1951-02-01
01022051 - expands to: 2051-02-01

note 1: if user only inputs two digits in year if it's less than 50 expands to the future,
        if it's more than 50 expands to the past.

note 2: only non numerica chars are wiped, that mean if user inputs something like 02-01 that
        will exand to {current year}-01-02.
